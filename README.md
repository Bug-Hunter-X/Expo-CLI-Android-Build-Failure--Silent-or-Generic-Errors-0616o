# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Silent or Generic Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI: silent or generic build failures.  The error messages are often unhelpful, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

Building an Android APK using `expo build:android` results in a failure without clear indication of the cause.  The error messages may be vague, such as 'build failed', or the build may fail silently without any output.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing the Android build logs to pinpoint the exact cause of the failure. This frequently reveals dependency conflicts, incorrect configuration, or issues within the Android build system itself. 

This repo demonstrates strategies for identifying these issues and resolving them: examining the build logs, verifying dependencies, and cleaning the build cache.
