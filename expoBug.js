This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The error message might not be very specific, but it often points to an issue with the Android build system or a dependency conflict within your project.  The build process might fail silently or throw a generic error like 'build failed'.  Debugging can be difficult as the root cause is buried within the Android build logs.
