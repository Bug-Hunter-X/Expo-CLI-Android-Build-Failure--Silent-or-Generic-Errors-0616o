The solution requires analyzing the Android build logs, which are typically quite extensive. You'll need to look for error messages, warnings, and stack traces. Common problems and solutions include:

* **Dependency Conflicts:** Ensure your project's package.json dependencies are compatible.  Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to inspect the dependency tree and identify any conflicts.
* **Incorrect Configuration:** Double-check your `app.json` and `android/app/build.gradle` files for any misconfigurations or typos.
* **Cleaning the Build Cache:** Often, a clean build is sufficient to resolve transient errors. Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android`.
* **Gradle Issues:** Problems with Gradle itself might necessitate updates or system-level fixes. Check the Gradle version and make sure it is compatible with your project and Expo CLI.
* **SDK Issues:** Problems with the Android SDK require checking for updates and correct configurations.

**Example Log Analysis:**

If the logs reveal an error like `Could not find method android() for arguments [:] on object com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.BaseAppModuleExtension`, this points to an outdated version of the Gradle plugin. To solve this, consider updating Gradle or reviewing the Android build files for compatibility issues.

**To obtain the logs:**

When you execute the Expo build command, ensure you're monitoring the console output carefully. You may need to run the build command without any additional arguments to get the full logs displayed.
